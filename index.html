		What is Pm 2.5
	</h3>
	<p> Pm 2.5 is a category of particulate matter which are 2.5 micrometers and smaller. When inhaled, it can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. Sensitive groups are vulnerable to severe symptoms in the respiratory system. They are often made up of harmful chemicals from power plants, automobiles, and fires. However, Pm 2.5 is just a small part of pollution. There are many other factors that contribute to air pollution, but Pm 2.5 can be lethal to human respiratory health.
